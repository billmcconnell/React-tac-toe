# React-tac-toe
A React-based tic-tac-toe game (for educational purposes only)

This is a project that demonstrated the useState React hook as well as techniques for passing state between parent and child components.

- Auto-refresh the page after gameplay is complete using window.location.reload
- An alert dialog announcing which player won
- Prevent the same square from being selected twice (check the state of the square and prevent the move if the square is in a state other than the initial state)
- Improve the graphics
